# HumanitarianCrisisPrediction

A humanitarian crisis (or "humanitarian disaster") is defined as a singular event or a series of events that are threatening in terms of health, safety or well-being of a community or large group of people. (1)


Can one predict the timing of future crisis by looking for clues in world news events data?
“what is the probability that a country will have a humanitarian within the next X months?”
